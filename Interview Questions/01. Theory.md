## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. 
- Helps you organize and structure your code by creating classes as ***blueprints for objects***. 
- Each class has ***attributes*** that define its unique characteristics and ***methods*** that represent its behaviors. 
- You can create objects from these classes, each with its own specific attributes and behaviors. 
- OOP allows you to model complex systems, relationships, and interactions in a more organized and manageable way.

## What are the four fundamental principles of OOP?
- ***Encapsulation***: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (object) and hiding internal implementation details.
- ***Inheritance***: Defining new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods.
- ***Polymorphism***: The ability of objects to take on multiple forms and respond differently based on the context.
- ***Abstraction***: Simplifying complex systems by providing a simplified representation and only exposing relevant details.

## What is a class in Python?
- A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. 
- It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class should have.

## What is an object in Python?
- An object is an instance of a class. 
- It represents a specific entity or concept, possessing the properties and behaviors defined in the class.

## What is the difference between a class and an object?
- A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It is a general concept. 
- An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a classâ€”an actual representation of the class with specific values for its attributes.

## What is the role of self in Python class methods?
- In Python, the self parameter refers to the instance of the class itself. 
- It is used within methods to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and methods.

## What is method overriding?
- Method overriding is a feature of OOP that allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
- The overridden method in the subclass is called instead of the superclass method when invoked.

## What is method overloading?
- Method overloading is not directly supported in Python. 
- It refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class. 
- However, in Python, you can achieve similar functionality by using default parameter values or using variable-length arguments (*args or **kwargs).

# Map is used to apply some logic(function) to each item of an input iterable
# As a result it produces the map object.
# NOTE : The returned value from map() (map object) then can be passed to functions like list() (to create a list), set() (to create a set) .
# Syntax: map(fun, iter)
  # fun : It is a function to which map passes each element of given iterable.
  # iter : It is a iterable which is to be mapped.
